## Description of the project 
An xkcd-style password generator

## Details for teaching team
P2.php's form submits to xkcd.php
xkcd.php reads from CSV file and randomly populates an array
user's selection of number of words, and inclusion (or exclusion) of symbols, numbers and capitalization incorporated

## Outside code
Used a version of the online wordlist for the dictionary
No outside code used, but the samples gave directions and ideas as to how to approach the project.
Also looked up generic Javascript error-checking for the form submission to have the user at-least submit the number of words
Not quite working as of this version 1
