## Description of the project 
An xkcd-style password generator

## Details for teaching team
*P2.php*'s form submits to *xkcd.php*

*xkcd.php* reads from CSV file and randomly populates an array

User's selection of **number of words**, and inclusion (or exclusion) of **symbols**, **numbers** and **capitalization** incorporated.

## Outside code
Used a version of the online wordlist for the dictionary.

No outside code used, but the samples gave directions and ideas as to how to approach the project.

Also looked up generic Javascript error-checking for the form submission to have the user at least submit the number of words.
